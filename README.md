There are two assignments:
1) Predict the classes for the fashion data set
2) Predict the position of the planets as a function of time for the dataset that can be downloaded at the following link:
https://www.dropbox.com/s/uahmj0rr37629jd/planets_trajectories.npz?dl=0
The data set has the orbits of 4 planets each time step is 1e-4 years and the position coordinate is given in A.U.

In doing these projects you may want to consider topics such as:
- Using a validation set in addition to the test set (see https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/train_and_evaluate)
- Hyperparameters: regularization, learning rate, etc. 
- Neural Net architecture (convolution layers, etc.), preprocessing, descriptors
